# Sprint 8: Project l Urban Routes Web app Testing

## Description:
This project is an end-to-end(E2E) test of the Urban Routes Web App which focuses on evaluating the appâ€™s user interface covering the entire process of ordering a taxi from start to finish. The purpose of this test is to ensure the functionality of the Urban Routes Web app. 

## Tools and Techniques Used :

- **WebdriverIO**: A framework for end-to-end testing of web pages.<br>

- **Node.js**: Used for running scripts and managing project dependencies.<br>

- **Mocha**: A testing framework to structure the tests with `describe` and `it` functions.<br>

- **DevTools**: Used to locate webpage elements using CSS or XPath selectors.<br>

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: This approach helps to organize test code by separating page elements and actions into reusable modules.<br>

- **JavaScript Modules** : In this javascript module, functions are created and exported by using `module.exports` and imported to other parts of the project by using `require` function.<br>

- **Visual Studio Code** : To work with test execution.<br>


## Set up the environment:

- Install `Node.js` and `npm` command line by using: 
    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```
- Install all the necessary dependencies to work with WebdriverIO by using the command:
    ```bash
    npm wdio config
    ```

## Test Files
1. createAnOrder.e2e.js

    This file is created to test the process of ordering a taxi which includes:

- Setting address
- Selecting a supportive plan
- Adding a phone number
- Adding a credit card
- Writing a message to the driver.
- Ordering blankets and handkerchiefs
- Adding ice cream.
- Verifying the appearance of the car  search and driver info model.

2. page.js

    This file is created to store the selectors selectors and actions to interact with page elements.

3. helper.js
    In this file, functions are created to generate the number and getting the elements by text.

4. wdio.conf.js
    It is a configuration file which consists of settings like baseURL, log level, capabilities, and services that helps in running tests.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure the `baseURL` is updated in `wdio.cong.js` file where the server url can be obtained through Tripleten Platform. <br>


## Execution of test:
After setting up the environment the test and creating the test files. Finally, the test can be run by using the command:
```bash
npm run wdio
```
